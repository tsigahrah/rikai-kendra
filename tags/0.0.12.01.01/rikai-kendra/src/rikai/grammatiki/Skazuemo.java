/**
 * A <b>predicate</b> is one of the two main parts of a sentence, the other being the subject, which
 * the predicate modifies. For the simple sentence "John is yellow", <i>John</i> acts as the
 * subject, and <i>is yellow</i> acts as the predicate (a subsequent description of the subject,
 * headed with a verb).
 * <p>
 * In current linguistic semantics, a predicate is an expression that can be true of something;
 * Thus, the expressions "is yellow" or "is like broccoli" are true of those things that are yellow
 * or like broccoli, respectively. This notion is closely related to the notion of a predicate in
 * formal logic, which includes more expressions than the former one.
 * <p>
 * <b>Skazuemo</b> is the latin-phonetical spelling of <i>сказуемо</i> the <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language" target="_blank">Bulgarian</a> word for
 * <i>predicate</i>.
