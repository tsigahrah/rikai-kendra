/**
 * The <b>subject</b> is one of the two main constituents of a clause. The other constituent is the
 * predicate. For the simple sentence "John is yellow", <i>John</i> acts as the subject, and <i>is
 * yellow</i> acts as the predicate (a subsequent description of the subject, headed with a verb).
 * <p>
 * The subject has the grammatical function in a sentence of relating its constituent (a noun
 * phrase) by means of the verb to any other elements present in the sentence, i.e. objects,
 * complements and adverbials.<br>
 * The subject is a phrasal constituent, and should be distinguished from parts of speech, which,
 * roughly, classify words within constituent.
 * <p>
 * <b>Podlog</b> is the latin-phonetical spelling of <i>подлог</i> the <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language" target="_blank">Bulgarian</a> word for
 * <i>subject</i>.
